I'm currently studying at [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu) and will be graduating in May 2017 with a Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Upon graduation, I will be joining [Capital One](https://capitalone.com) as a Associate Software Engineer in the Technology Development Program.

Some things I enjoy or have an interest in: [reading books](https://trello.com/b/rFnTeKW3/books), [startups and entrepreneurship](https://medium.com/@virjog/what-i-learned-at-startup-school-34c9ae9b0d82), and [hackathons](https://devpost.com/virjog).
